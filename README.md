Solves an arbitrary version of that one problem from Die Hard 3 with the water jugs. Given some number of jugs with some capacity each and an infinite water supply, measure a specific amount of water using just the jugs that you have. You can only fill a jug to full, empty a jug, or fill a jug with another jug. You can't measure exactly how much a jug has, nor can you partially empty a jug.
